# Group 3 Activity

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Group 3's project revolves around mastering Git and GitHub workflows. The goal was to create individual filesâ€”`about.md`, `contact.md`, and `bday.md`â€”each focusing on different personal information. These files were developed in separate branches, then reviewed and merged into the main branch. The project culminated in a detailed `README.md` that outlines the purpose, structure, and instructions for collaboration.

The process involved:
- Creating feature branches for each file.
- Submitting pull requests for review and feedback.
- Merging changes into the `main` branch for final integration.

This approach ensured smooth collaboration, version control, and a polished final product.
